# Basic-chatbot
# Python Voice-Controlled Chatbot

This repository contains the code for a simple yet interactive chatbot that responds to your voice commands. Using Python's speech_recognition and pyttsx3 libraries, this chatbot showcases the power of integrating speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities in a Python application.

## What's Inside?

The chatbot is programmed to listen to your spoken words, interpret them, and then respond vocally. It's a basic framework demonstrating how you can integrate voice recognition and speech output in Python.

## How It Works

**Listening:** The chatbot listens to your speech through the microphone, adjusting to ambient noise for better accuracy.

**Understanding:** It converts your spoken words into text using **Google's speech recognition API**, of course, you can try other options.

**Responding:** Upon recognizing specific keywords (like 'hello'), the chatbot responds with a pre-programmed message.

## Potential Uses

**Personal Assistant:** Expand it into a personal voice assistant for day-to-day tasks.

**Educational Tool:** Use it as a base project to teach speech processing concepts.

**Interactive Voice Response:** Integrate into applications requiring voice-based interactions.

## Do your own chatbot:

This project is open for experimentation and improvement. Feel free to fork, modify, and expand its capabilities. Whether you're a beginner in Python or an AI enthusiast, this chatbot serves as a great starting point for understanding and building voice-interactive systems.

Additionally you have my own chatbot(**I.G.O.R**) wich you can see and copy for inspiration.
